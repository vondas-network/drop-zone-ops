## Project setup

### Create Python virtual environment
In a nutshell, Python virtual environments help decouple and isolate Python installs and associated pip packages. This allows end-users to install and manage their own set of packages that are independent of those provided by the system or used by other projects.
```bash
 cd videobeaux
 python -m venv env
```

### Activate Virtual Environment
This will activate your virtual environment. Immediately, you will notice that your terminal path includes env, signifying an activated virtual environment.

``` bash
source env/bin/activate
```
